## 🎯 **My Contributions**
As the **Gameplay Developer**, I was responsible for designing and implementing **core game mechanics**, including:

✅ **Turret AI & Auto-Targeting System** – Developed turrets that dynamically track and engage enemies within range.  
✅ **Projectile & Homing Behavior** – Implemented physics-driven projectiles that adjust trajectory to hit moving targets.  
✅ **Enemy AI & Pathfinding Optimization** – Ensured smooth enemy movement and AI logic, reducing unintended behaviors.  
✅ **Resource & Upgrade System** – Designed an intuitive **UI for turret management, resource tracking, and balance adjustments**.  
✅ **Level Design & Scene Setup** – Created diverse levels with **unique aesthetics and strategic placements**.  
✅ **Gameplay Debugging & Optimization** – Fixed major gameplay bugs, such as projectiles flying to (0,0,0) upon enemy death.

## 💡 **Challenges & Solutions**
### 🔸 **Bullet Trajectory Issue**
**Problem:** Projectiles flew to (0,0,0) after enemy destruction.  
**Solution:** Implemented an immediate projectile destruction check upon enemy death, preventing unintended movement.  

### 🔸 **Game Balance & Player Experience**
**Problem:** Turret cost, enemy health scaling, and overall difficulty needed fine-tuning.  
**Solution:** Introduced a **progressive difficulty system** that scales dynamically based on wave progression.  

### 🔸 **UI & Resource Management**
**Problem:** Initial UI was unintuitive for upgrades and purchases.  
**Solution:** Redesigned **interactive UI elements** for a smoother player experience, allowing clear upgrade and sell options.

## 📌 **How to Play**
1. **Strategically place turrets** to defend against incoming waves of enemies.
2. **Upgrade turrets** to increase attack power and efficiency.
3. **Manage in-game currency** to optimize defense placement.
4. **Survive all enemy waves** to win the game!
